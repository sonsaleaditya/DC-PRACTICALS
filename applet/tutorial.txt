# Age Calculator Applet

This repository contains a simple Java applet, **AgeCalculatorApplet**, and its corresponding HTML file for embedding and running the applet.

## Description

The **AgeCalculatorApplet** allows users to input their birth year and calculates their age based on the current year. The applet is embedded in an HTML file for demonstration purposes.

## Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**  
   - Java 8 is recommended. Ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set.  
   - Use `AppletViewer` if your browser does not support applets.

2. **AppletViewer**  
   - Included in the JDK and suitable for viewing applets when browser support is unavailable.

## Files Provided

1. **`AgeCalculatorApplet.java`**: The source code for the applet.  
2. **`Applet.html`**: The HTML file that embeds the applet.

## Steps to Run

### 1. Compile the Applet

Navigate to the directory containing the `AgeCalculatorApplet.java` file and run:

```bash
javac AgeCalculatorApplet.java
```

This will generate a `AgeCalculatorApplet.class` file in the same directory.

### 2. Run the Applet

There are two ways to run the applet:

#### Option 1: Using AppletViewer

Run the applet using the `AppletViewer` tool provided with the JDK:

```bash
appletviewer Applet.html
```

#### Option 2: Using a Web Browser

1. Open the `Applet.html` file in an older browser that supports applets (e.g., older versions of Internet Explorer or Firefox).  
2. Alternatively, use a local HTTP server to serve the file:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000  # For Python 3 users
   ```

   Then, open the file in a browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/Applet.html`.

### 3. Interact with the Applet

Once the applet is running, enter your birth year and interact with the interface to calculate your age.

## Notes

- Modern browsers do not support Java applets. Use `AppletViewer` or set up a virtual machine with an older browser to run the applet.
- Ensure Java security settings allow running unsigned applets.

## Example Output

When the applet runs successfully, you will see a form prompting for the birth year. After entering a value, the applet will display the calculated age.
