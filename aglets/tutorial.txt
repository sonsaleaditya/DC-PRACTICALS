# Distributed Computing Programs with Aglets

This repository contains distributed computing programs built using **Aglets**, a Java-based mobile agent framework.

## Prerequisites

Before running the programs, ensure the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Java 8 is required.
- **Apache Ant**: Provided as `apache-ant-1.10.15-bin.zip` in this repository.
- **Aglets**: The Aglets framework for mobile agents.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Download and Install Aglets

1. Download Aglets from the [official website](http://aglets.sourceforge.net/) or the provided distribution.  
2. Extract the contents to a directory of your choice, e.g., `~/aglets`.

### 2. Install Apache Ant

1. Download the provided `apache-ant-1.10.15-bin.zip` file from this repository.  
2. Extract it to the `~/aglets` directory or any directory of your choice.

   Example:

   ```bash
   unzip apache-ant-1.10.15-bin.zip -d ~/aglets
   ```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the following configuration and add it to your environment file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

    ```bash
    # Apache Ant setup
    export ANT_HOME=~/aglets/apache-ant-1.10.15
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin

    # Java setup
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
    export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

    # Aglets setup
    export AGLETS_HOME=~/aglets
    export PATH=$PATH:$AGLETS_HOME
    export PATH=$PATH:$AGLETS_HOME/bin
    ```

2. Reload the environment variables by running:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
    ```

### 4. Verify Setup

Run the following commands to verify the installation:

```bash
java -version       # Should display Java 8
ant -version        # Should display Apache Ant version
```

## Running the Programs

1. Navigate to the Aglets `bin` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~/aglets/bin
    ```

2. Start the Aglets platform:

    ```bash
    ./aglets
    ```

3. Follow the program-specific instructions provided in this repository to execute the desired tasks.
