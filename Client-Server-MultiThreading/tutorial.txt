# Number System Converter - Multi-Threaded Client-Server Application

This project implements a **multi-threaded TCP server** and a **TCP client** to perform number system conversions (Decimal to Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal). The server can handle multiple clients concurrently using Java's `ExecutorService`.

---

## Overview

- **Server**: Accepts decimal numbers from clients and converts them into Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal formats.
- **Client**: Connects to the server, sends a decimal number, and receives the converted results.

---

## Features

1. **Multi-threaded Server**:
   - Handles up to 10 clients simultaneously using a thread pool.
   - Converts decimal numbers to Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal formats.

2. **TCP Client**:
   - Connects to the server and communicates via TCP.
   - Reads input from the user and sends it to the server for conversion.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure JDK 8 or above is installed.
2. **Network Setup**: 
   - Update the server IP address in the client program (`TcpClient.java`) to match the server machine's IP.

---

## Files Provided

1. **`NumberSystemConverterServer.java`**: The multi-threaded TCP server.
2. **`TcpClient.java`**: The TCP client program.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Compile the Programs

```bash
javac NumberSystemConverterServer.java
javac TcpClient.java
```

### Step 2: Start the Server

Run the server program:

```bash
java NumberSystemConverterServer
```

The server will start and listen on port `1234` for incoming connections.

### Step 3: Start the Client

Run the client program:

```bash
java TcpClient
```

- The client connects to the server and exchanges data.
- Enter a decimal number when prompted to see the converted results.

## Example Interaction

### Server Output

```
Server started. Waiting for clients...
Client connected: 192.168.177.200
Client converted: 15
Client converted: 255
Client disconnected.
```

### Client Output
